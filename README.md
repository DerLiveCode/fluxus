Online documentation: http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/docs/0.17/en/index.html

Fluxus is based on Racket, a successor of Scheme. For a beginner the official Racket documentation, even though it is comprehensive, lacks simple and understandable examples. Nontheless digging into it is highly recommended.
